# Introduction

In-context learning refers to the ability of a neural network to learn from information presented in its context. While traditional learning in neural networks requires adjusting network weights for every new task, in-context learning operates purely by updating internal activations without needing any updates to network weights. The emergence of this ability in large language models has led to a paradigm shift in machine learning and has forced researchers to reconceptualize how they think about learning in neural networks. Looking beyond language models, we can find in-context learning in many computational models relevant to cognitive science, including those that emerge from meta-learning. 

The present workshop aims to delineate and discuss the implications of this phenomenon for the cognitive sciences. For this, we have invited a diverse group of researchers to map out the following questions:
- How well can human learning be modeled using in-context learning? 
- Which neural architectures support in-context learning?
- When and why do natural and artificial systems rely on in-context versus in-weights learning?
- How does in-context learning relate to classical concepts from cognitive science?
